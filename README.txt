This project originated because EBSCO's knowledge base for their ERM did not contain collection statistics needed for surveys and reports.

To download your entire knowledge base (KB) 
    1) Go to EBSCOadmin
    2) Select Holdings Management
    3) Select Download
        Under Type: select Standard
        Under Format: select CSV
        
I typically download the entire KB with no selections, preferring to do my filtering in Python.
